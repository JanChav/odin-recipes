    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Flour tortillas are a staple in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. These soft, pliable flatbreads 
        are made from just a few simple ingredients - flour, water, fat, and salt. The dough is 
        kneaded, then rolled out into thin rounds and cooked on a hot griddle or pan until lightly browned.</p>

    <p>Flour tortillas are incredibly versatile - they can be used as a wrap for tacos, burritos, 
        quesadillas, and more. The dough can also be cut into wedges and fried to make crispy
        tortilla chips. Homemade flour tortillas are far superior to store-bought in both flavor and
        texture. With just a little bit of time and effort, you can enjoy freshly made tortillas that are
        soft, chewy, and utterly delicious.</p>

    <p>This recipe will walk you through the easy steps to make your own homemade flour
        tortillas from scratch. Let's get started!</p>
