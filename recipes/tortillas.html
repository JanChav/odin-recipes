    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Flour tortillas are a staple in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. These soft, pliable flatbreads 
        are made from just a few simple ingredients - flour, water, fat, and salt. The dough is 
        kneaded, then rolled out into thin rounds and cooked on a hot griddle or pan until lightly browned.</p>

    <p>Flour tortillas are incredibly versatile - they can be used as a wrap for tacos, burritos, 
        quesadillas, and more. The dough can also be cut into wedges and fried to make crispy
        tortilla chips. Homemade flour tortillas are far superior to store-bought in both flavor and
        texture. With just a little bit of time and effort, you can enjoy freshly made tortillas that are
        soft, chewy, and utterly delicious.</p>

    <p>This recipe will walk you through the easy steps to make your own homemade flour
        tortillas from scratch. Let's get started!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable shortening or lard</li>
            <li>3/4cup warm water</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening using a pastry cutter or two forks until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the warm water while stirring the mixture with a fork. Continue mixing until a mildy sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball out into a thin, round tortilla, about 6-8 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook the tortillas one or two at a time, for 30-60 seconds per side, until lightly browned and puffed up.</li>
            <li>Stack the cooked tortillas and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your fresh, homemade flour tortillas! They are delicious on their own or used for tacos, burritos, quesadillas and more.</p>
