    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to form a roux.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened to a creamy consistency, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the cheddar, Parmesan, and cream cheese until the cheeses are melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish. At this point, you can serve it immediately or bake it for a firmer texture.</li>
            <li>To bake, preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the edges are bubbling and the top is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Let the mac and cheese cool for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
