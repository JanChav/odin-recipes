    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Browned butter cookies are a delightful spin on a classic cookie.
    The process of browning the butter adds a rich, nutty flavor that takes 
    these cookies to new heights.</p>

    <p>The browned butter provides a depth of flavor that regular butter
        simply can't match. As the butter cooks, the milk solids caramelize, 
        resulting in a cookie that's both buttery and slightly toffee-like in taste.
        The brown sugar and vanilla complement the browned butter beautifully, 
        creating a cookie that's simultaneously sweet, savory, and utterly irresistible.</p>
    
    <p>These cookies have a soft, chewy center with slightly crisp edges. 
        The interior is fudgy and decadent, while the outside maintains a
        perfect balance of crisp and crumbly. They're the kind of cookie you 
        can't stop at just one - the complex flavors will have you reaching for more.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a light-colored saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a heatproof bowl. Allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the browned butter and both sugars. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg and vanilla until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. The dough will be thick.</li>
            <li>Scoop rounds of dough, about 2 tablespoons each, onto parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake at 375Â°F for 9-11 minutes, until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy the rich, nutty flavor of these delicious browned butter cookies!</p>
